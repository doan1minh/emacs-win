       gnutls_priority_t * priority_cache
                   is a ggnnuuttllss__pprriioorriittiittyy__tt structure.

       const char * priorities
                   is a string describing priorities

       const char ** err_pos
                   In case of an error this will  have  the  position  in  the
                   string the error occurred

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Sets  priorities  for  the ciphers, key exchange methods, macs and com-
       pression methods.

       The pprriioorriittiieess option allows you to specify a colon separated  list  of
       the  cipher priorities to enable.  Some keywords are defined to provide
       quick access to common preferences.

       Unless there is a special need, use the "NORMAL"  keyword  to  apply  a
       reasonable security level, or "NORMAL:CCOOMMPPAATT" for compatibility.

       "PERFORMANCE"  means all the "secure" ciphersuites are enabled, limited
       to 128 bit ciphers and sorted by terms of speed performance.

       "LEGACY" the NORMAL settings for GnuTLS 3.2.x or earlier. There  is  no
       verification profile set, and the allowed DH primes are considered weak
       today.

       "NORMAL" means all  "secure"  ciphersuites.  The  256-bit  ciphers  are
       included  as  a fallback only.  The ciphers are sorted by security mar-
       gin.

       "PFS" means all "secure"  ciphersuites  that  support  perfect  forward
       secrecy.   The  256-bit  ciphers  are included as a fallback only.  The
       ciphers are sorted by security margin.

       "SECURE128" means all "secure" ciphersuites of security  level  128-bit
       or more.

       "SECURE192"  means  all "secure" ciphersuites of security level 192-bit
       or more.

       "SUITEB128" means all the NSA SuiteB ciphersuites with  security  level
       of 128.

       "SUITEB192"  means  all the NSA SuiteB ciphersuites with security level
       of 192.

       "EXPORT" means all ciphersuites are enabled, including the low-security
       40 bit ciphers.

       "NONE" means nothing is enabled.  This disables even protocols and com-
       pression methods.

       " _K_E_Y_W_O_R_D " The system administrator  imposed  settings.  The  provided
       keywords  will  be  expanded  from a configuration-time provided file -
       default is: /etc/gnutls/default-priorities. Any  keywords  that  follow
       it,  will  be  appended  to  the expanded string. If there is no system
       string, then the function will fail. The system file should be  format-
       ted as "KEYWORD=VALUE", e.g., "SYSTEM=NORMAL:-ARCFOUR-128".

       Special  keywords  are  "!",  "-" and "+".  "!" or "-" appended with an
       algorithm will remove this algorithm.  "+" appended with  an  algorithm
       will add this algorithm.

       Check  the GnuTLS manual section "Priority strings" for detailed infor-
       mation.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+MAC-ALL:+RSA:+AES-128-CBC:+SIGN-ALL:+COMP-NULL"

       "NORMAL:-ARCFOUR-128" means normal ciphers except for ARCFOUR-128.

       "SECURE128:-VERS-SSL3.0:+COMP-DEFLATE" means that only  secure  ciphers
       are enabled, SSL3.0 is disabled, and libz compression enabled.

       "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL:+SIGN-RSA-SHA1",

       "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+AES-128-CBC:+ECDHE-RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL:+SIGN-RSA-SHA1:+CURVE-SECP256R1",

       "SECURE256:+SECURE128",

       Note that "NORMAL:CCOOMMPPAATT" is the most compatible mode.
