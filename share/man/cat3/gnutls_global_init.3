       This  function  performs any required precalculations, detects the sup-
       ported CPU capabilities and initializes  the  underlying  cryptographic
       backend.  In  order to free any resources taken by this call you should
       ggnnuuttllss__gglloobbaall__ddeeiinniitt(()) when gnutls usage is no longer needed.

       This    function    increments    a    global    counter,    so    that
       ggnnuuttllss__gglloobbaall__ddeeiinniitt(())  only releases resources when it has been called
       as many times as ggnnuuttllss__gglloobbaall__iinniitt(()).  This is useful when  GnuTLS  is
       used  by more than one library in an application.  This function can be
       called many times, but will only do something the first time.

       Since GnuTLS 3.3.0 this function is only required in  systems  that  do
       not support library constructors and static linking. This function also
       became thread safe.

       A subsequent call of this function  if  the  initial  has  failed  will
       return the same error code.

       On  success,  GGNNUUTTLLSS__EE__SSUUCCCCEESSSS  (0)  is  returned, otherwise a negative
       error code is returned.
