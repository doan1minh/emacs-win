       TLS  debug  client. It sets up multiple TLS connections to a server and
       queries its capabilities. It was created to assist in debugging GnuTLS,
       but it might be useful to extract a TLS server's capabilities.  It con-
       nects to a TLS server, performs tests and print the server's  capabili-
       ties.  If called with the `-v' parameter more checks will be performed.
       Can be used to check for servers with special needs or bugs.

              Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer  number  as  its
              argument.  The value of _n_u_m_b_e_r is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 9999

              Specifies the debug level.

       --VV, ----vveerrbboossee
              More verbose output.  This option may appear an unlimited number
              of times.


       --pp _n_u_m_b_e_r, ----ppoorrtt=_n_u_m_b_e_r
              The port to connect to.  This option takes an integer number as
              its argument.  The value of _n_u_m_b_e_r is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 65536


       ----aapppp--pprroottoo=_s_t_r_i_n_g
              The application protocol to be used to obtain the server's cer-
              tificate (https, smtp, imap).


       --hh, ----hheellpp
              Display usage information and exit.

       --!!, ----mmoorree--hheellpp
              Pass the extended usage information through a pager.

       --vv [{_v_|_c_|_n ----vveerrssiioonn [{_v_|_c_|_n}]}]
              Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a
              simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information
              and `n' will print the full copyright notice.
